# Neural Networks and Handwriting Recognition (CS251 Project)

This project implements a neural network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using **Radial Basis Functions (RBF)** in the hidden layer. The goal is to train a model that can accurately recognize digits (0–9) from image data.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a neural network from scratch using RBFs
- Perform digit classification on real image datasets (MNIST)
- Apply K-means clustering to determine RBF centers
- Use linear regression for final output prediction
- Gain experience with Gaussian distributions and supervised learning

## 🧠 Core Concepts
- Neural networks and RBFs
- K-means clustering for feature learning
- Image data preprocessing and reshaping
- Training and testing with labeled data
- Accuracy evaluation and confusion matrix analysis

## 🧪 Project Structure
- `rbf_net.py`: Main code for the RBF neural network implementation
- `rbf.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training, testing, and visualizing results

## 🗃️ Dataset
- **MNIST Dataset**:
  - `mnist_train_data.npy`, `mnist_train_labels.npy`
  - `mnist_test_data.npy`, `mnist_test_labels.npy`
- **RBF Dev Set**:
  - `rbf_dev_train.csv`, `rbf_dev_test.csv`

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Notes
This project was developed as part of Colby’s CS251 course to explore machine learning, computer vision, and neural networks using foundational tools and concepts from scratch.
